## Understanding Progress States

Questions move through different states based on your performance:

1. **NEW** → First time seeing this question
2. **WRONG** → Answered incorrectly (resets to this state on any wrong answer)
3. **RIGHT** → Answered correctly 1-2 times
4. **MASTERED** → Answered correctly 3+ times consecutively

**Key Points:**
- Getting a question wrong resets it to "Wrong" state
- You must answer correctly 3+ times to master a question
- Mastered questions are excluded from future quizzes
- You can manually mark questions as mastered (see below)

## Mark as Mastered

If you're confident you know a question:
